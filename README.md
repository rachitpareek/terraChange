# terraChange

terraChange aims to revolutionize the outdated bottle recycling system by integrating and gamifying the process for the end consumer. This app was built using flask, bootstrap, gcloud, & [a QR code generator](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator). It is available live at `link.com`.


# Inherency

Since 6 billion bottles and cans ended up in the landfill, nobody claimed the CRV on them. How much CRV? More than $100 million worth! https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/consumers/facts

## water bottles creation

according to statista, 13.7 billion gallons of bottled water sold across the US in 2017. This translates to the equivalent of roughly 103 billion 16.9 fluid ounce sized water bottles being consumed each year - just in the United States. Globally, this number increases, with the equivalent of 783 billion such water bottles being sold! This amounts to millions of tons of plastic waste, and unfortunately is not being 

## recycling effectiveness
At 33.4%, the recycling rate for single serve PET plastic bottled water containers has doubled in the last ten years.
https://www.bottledwater.org/education/recycling
More than 90% of U.S. households have access to curbside and drop off recycling programs
Of all the plastics produced in the United States, PET plastic bottled water packaging makes up only 0.92% -- less than one percent
Producing new products from rPET uses two-thirds less energy than required to make products from raw virgin materials. It also reduces greenhouse gas emissions
Recycling a single plastic bottle can conserve enough energy to light a 60-watt light bulb for up to six hours

## curr incentive system
we use this for library books, loyalty programs, batteries (and all sorts of other hazardous waste). curr system is informal af and we can legitimize it. this gamifies the system and fits into exixsting workflow.  

california has one of the best recycling systems in place. hi, or, etc. change this and save earth
